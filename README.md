# Unknown_Plant_Control
Use internal model control idea
use deep learning(CNN) to learn the plant model from unknown plant
use deep learning(CNN) to learn a reverse plant model to be the controller
Add feedcak part, use the RNN idea to learn the feedback parameters.
Achieve constant signal tracking for the unknown plant
